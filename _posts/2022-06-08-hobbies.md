Some of my hobbies are baking, playing the cello, listening to music, drawing, painting, and watching tv/movies!
1) Most of the things I bake are sweet, like brownies and cookies. But I also like to bake biscuits and bread. 
2) Music is one of my greatest passions-- whether it is playing it myself or listening to it. I like almost all genres of music from classical to hip-hop.
3) I have played the cello since I was in 4th grade. I have stopped playing in the school, but I continue to take private lessons and further my education.
4) Art has been a lifelong hobby for me. I enjoy looking at art and making my own.
5) I love watching tv and movies. My family is very interested in movies as well, and they have definitely influenced me in that area.
